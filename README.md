# Creating a SPA to register users. And then log them in.

I followed [this](https://www.codementor.io/blizzerand/building-forms-using-react-everything-you-need-to-know-iz3eyoq4y) tutorial to learn React, and used it as a basis to learn how to write forms in React.js. This repo (the login form and the server) is built on top of the one mentioned in that tuorial.

### What to learn next?
1. What are the best react.js coding practices? The code [and the snippets I have copied from SO] *feel* very clumsy to me.
2. What are the best express.js coding practices? How should I organize my code?
3. The  react-app and the express app are literally **not connected** with each other. Of course react-app hits the endpoints in express server, but that's the extent of it. They are independant of each other. Is this how it is supposed to be? I have to literally run them separately, can I write a script to make them run 'together'? Someone help me!
